But with powerful telescopes, they have detected a chemical — phosphine — in the thick Venus atmosphere. After much analysis, the scientists assert that something now alive is the only explanation for the chemical’s source.","likes":118,"comments":[{"author":"","date":"","text":"","likes":3},{"author":"Shannon","date":"2021-02-03","text":"abcde","likes":2},{"author":"Kenneth","date":"2021-03-09","text":"dsa","likes":2}]},"Is_There_Really_Life_on_Venus_There's_Only_One_Way_to_Know_for_Sure":{"date":"9/26/20","author":"David Grinspoon","publication":"Scientific American","text":"Now Greaves, et al., have reported the detection of phosphine on the closest planet in the universe to ours. No matter what, the report of finding this stinky, toxic, perhaps biogenic gas on our neighbor Venus will advance the science of atmospheric biosignature detection. If it’s not really phosphine, we will learn something about the difficulty of this kind of observation and the need to proceed with caution. If phosphine really does exist on Venus in the quantity reported (concentrations up to 20 parts per billion), we stand to learn something more profound.  Clever chemists will now be trying to come up with alternative, nonbiological sources that produce phosphine in sufficient amounts. If they succeed, we learn something new, perhaps something important, about Venus and other planets. And we learn about the limitations of using atmospheric biosignatures to infer life.","likes":12,"comments":[{"author":"Shannon","date":"","text":"das","likes":7},{"author":"Nadia","date":"","text":"asd","likes":7}]},"Promising_sign_of_life_on_Venus_might_not_exist_after_all":{"date":"10/23/20","author":"Nadia Drake","publication":"National Geographic","text":"Astronomers recently found a tantalizing hint that life could be wafting through the clouds shrouding Venus. But it seems the hunt for extraterrestrial life is far from over, as new research is already calling that discovery into question.\n The detection of phosphine gas in Venus’s atmosphere, announced last month, ignited a firestorm of speculation about whether the gas could be produced by alien microbes on the planet, where NASA is currently considering sending a spacecraft. However, three independent studies now have failed to find evidence of phosphine in the Venusian atmosphere.","likes":1,"comments":[{"author":"Shannon","date":"","text":"sa","likes":13}]},"da":{"date":"das","author":"Shannon","publication":"as","text":"asd","comments":[{"author":"Shannon","date":"","text":"das","likes":4}]},"as":{"date":"2021-02-02","author":"David","publication":"asd","text":"ad","comments":[{"author":"Shannon","date":"2021-02-02","text":"dfghjk","likes":1}]},"":{"date":"","author":"Shannon","publication":"","text":"","comments":[]}}
