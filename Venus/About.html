    <h4>Some Background:</h4>
  <p class = "background">
    Once thought to be devoid of life, scientists have found large traces of phosphine, a biosignature, high in Venus' atmosphere.
    <br>This could either be evidence of life or of an undiscovered geoligical process.
    <br>Venus had long been ignored by space exploration efforts, but it will now likely be the focus of new study.
    <br>I think it's really cool how much there is to explore and discover right next to earth!
